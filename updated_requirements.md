# Updated Admin Application Requirements

Based on user feedback, the following updates are required for the KSU Registration Admin Application:

## 1. Denial Reasons Update
- Remove "late request" as a denial reason since students cannot apply after the deadline
- Update the list of possible denial reasons to be more relevant to actual use cases

## 2. AI Decision-Making Enhancement
- Adjust the AI decision-making system to handle approximately 95% of cases automatically
- Reserve admin intervention only for special cases:
  - Students with special needs
  - Medical cases
  - Other exceptional circumstances that require human judgment

## 3. Request History Improvements
- Increase the number of requests displayed per page from 5 to 10
- Add statistics showing the percentage of AI-made decisions vs. admin-made decisions
- Enhance the filtering and sorting capabilities for better analysis

## 4. Logo Replacement
- Replace the placeholder/generated logo with the official KSU logo provided by the user
- Ensure the logo displays correctly across all pages and at various screen sizes

## 5. General UI Refinements
- Review and improve the overall user interface based on the updated requirements
- Ensure consistent styling throughout the application
- Optimize the layout for better usability

These updates will enhance the functionality and appearance of the admin application while better aligning it with the actual workflow of registration administrators at KSU.
