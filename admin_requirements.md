# Admin Requirements Analysis

## Overview
The registration responsible admin page will be a separate application with the same visual style as the student application. It will allow administrators to view and manage course registration requests.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Request Prioritization
Requests must be sorted and displayed according to the following priority levels:
1. If the student is a graduating senior
2. If the course is from a previous level (repeated/failed)
3. If the course is a prerequisite for two or more courses
4. Courses that are prerequisites for the graduation project
5. Reducing schedule gaps
6. Special medical cases
7. If the course is at the same academic level
8. If the student's total credit hours are less than the required minimum
9. If the student's total credit hours are low

### 2. Request Display
- Show approximately 4-5 requests at a time
- Each request should display:
  - Student information (name, ID, major)
  - Course information (code, name)
  - Request type (add/drop)
  - Priority level and reason
  - Submission date
  - Action buttons (approve/deny)

### 3. Request History
- Display previously processed requests, particularly denied ones
- Show whether the request was denied by AI or administrator
- Include date and time of the decision
- Possibly include reason for denial

### 4. User Interface
- Maintain the same visual style as the student application
- Provide clear, intuitive navigation
- Include filtering and search capabilities
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Application Structure
- Electron-based desktop application
- Same styling framework as the student application
- Modular architecture for maintainability

### 2. Data Management
- Mock data for demonstration purposes
- Structured to represent real database interactions
- Efficient sorting and filtering mechanisms

### 3. Business Logic
- Implementation of the priority algorithm
- Request approval/denial workflow
- History tracking

### 4. Security Considerations
- Admin authentication (simulated)
- Secure data handling
- Audit logging of admin actions
